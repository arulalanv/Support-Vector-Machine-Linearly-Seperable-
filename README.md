# Support Vector Machine (Linearly-Seperable)
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

# Design a Linear SVM to classify Linearly separable Data Points given Below.
Data Points for Positive Labels
[3,1] [3,-1] [6,-1] [6,-1]

Data Pijts for Negative Labels
[1,0] [0,1] [0,-1] [-1,0]
